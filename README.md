# hollysmpvproject

Do your usual git clone to get my repo
Yarn migrate will allow you to download my database
Run npm or yarn start - my local host is http://localhost:3000 for front end and http://localhost:5000 for backend
The API I used can be found here https://www.themoviedb.org/
... Good luck!
