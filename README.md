# hollysmpvproject

Do your usual git clone to get my repo
Yarn migrate will allow you to download my database
Run npm or yarn start - my local host is <http://localhost:3000> for front end and <http://localhost:5000> for backend
The API I used can be found here <https://www.themoviedb.org/>
... Good luck!
